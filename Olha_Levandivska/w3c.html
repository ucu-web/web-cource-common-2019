        <h2> Introduction </h2>

        <h3> Background </h3>
        <p> <em> This section is non-normative. </em> </p>
        <p>
          HTML is the World Wide Web’s core markup language. Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a language
          for semantically describing scientific documents. Its general design, however, has enabled it to be adapted,
          over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents and even applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p><em> This section is non-normative. </em> </p>
        <p>
          This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features defined in
          this specification, implementors of tools that operate on pages that use the features defined in this
          specification, and individuals wishing to establish the correctness of documents or implementations with
          respect to the requirements of this specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing familiarity with
          Web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity for completeness. More
          approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler introduction to the topic.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a complete understanding of some of the
          more technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML, Unicode, character
          encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in places but is not essential.
        </p>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
        <p>
          This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup language and associated semantic-level
          scripting APIs for authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static documents to dynamic
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope of this specification does not include providing mechanisms for media-specific customization of
          presentation (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included at the end of this specification,
          and several mechanisms for hooking into CSS are provided as part of the language).
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system. In particular, hardware
          configuration software, image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be expected to use with
          high-end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. In terms of applications, this specification is
          targeted specifically at applications that would be expected to be used by users on an occasional basis, or
          regularly but from disparate locations, with low CPU requirements. Examples of such applications include
          online purchasing systems, searching systems, games (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone
          books or address books, communications software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion
          software), document editing software, etc.
        </p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
        <p>
          For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a number of
          extensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the creation of the W3C, HTML’s development changed venue again. A first abortive attempt at extending
          HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as HTML 3.2, which was
          completed in 1997. HTML 4.01 quickly followed later that same year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following year, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on an XML-based
          equivalent, called XHTML. This effort started with a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML, known as XHTML 1.0,
          which added no new features except the new serialization, and which was completed in 2000. After XHTML 1.0,
          the W3C’s focus turned to making it easier for other working groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of
          XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C also worked on a new language that was not compatible
          with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages, calling it XHTML 2.0.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around the time that HTML’s evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML developed by browser
          vendors were specified and published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM Level 2 Core and DOM Level
          2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in 2003). These efforts then petered out, with some DOM Level 3
          specifications published in 2004 but the working group being closed before all the Level 3 drafts were
          completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was positioned as the next generation of Web forms,
          sparked a renewed interest in evolving HTML itself, rather than finding replacements for it. This interest
          was borne from the realization that XML’s deployment as a Web technology was limited to entirely new
          technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than as a replacement for existing deployed technologies
          (like HTML).
        </p>
        <p>
          A proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML 4.01’s forms to provide many of the features
          that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines that were incompatible
          with existing HTML Web pages, was the first result of this renewed interest. At this early stage, while the
          draft was already publicly available, and input was already being solicited from all sources, the
          specification was only under Opera Software’s copyright.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea that HTML’s evolution should be reopened was tested at a W3C workshop in 2004, where some of the
          principles that underlie the HTML work (described below), as well as the aforementioned early draft proposal
          covering just forms-related features, were presented to the W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera. The proposal
          was rejected on the grounds that the proposal conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web’s
          evolution; the W3C staff and membership voted to continue developing XML-based replacements instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue working on the
          effort under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG. A public mailing list was created, and the draft
          was moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was subsequently amended to be jointly owned by all three vendors,
          and to allow reuse of the specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          The WHATWG was based on several core principles, in particular that technologies need to be backwards
          compatible, that specifications and implementations need to match even if this means changing the
          specification rather than the implementations, and that specifications need to be detailed enough that
          implementations can achieve complete interoperability without reverse-engineering each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latter requirement in particular required that the scope of the HTML specification include what had
          previously been specified in three separate documents: HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.1, and DOM Level 2 HTML. It also
          meant including significantly more detail than had previously been considered the norm.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML 5.0 after all, and in 2007
          formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML specification. Apple,
          Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification under the W3C copyright, while keeping a
          version with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a number of years, both groups then worked together under the same editor: Ian Hickson. In 2011, the
          groups came to the conclusion that they had different goals: the W3C wanted to draw a line in the sand for
          features for a HTML 5.0 Recommendation, while the WHATWG wanted to continue working on a Living Standard for
          HTML, continuously maintaining the specification and adding new features. In mid 2012, a new editing team was
          introduced at the W3C to take care of creating a HTML 5.0 Recommendation and prepare a Working Draft for the
          next HTML version.
        </p>
        <p>Since then, the W3C Web Platform WG has been cherry picking patches from the WHATWG that resolved bugs
          registered on the W3C HTML specification or more accurately represented implemented reality in user agents.
          At time of publication of this document, patches from the <a href=""> WHATWG HTML specification </a> have been merged until
          January 12, 2016. The W3C HTML editors have also added patches that resulted from discussions and decisions
          made by the W3C Web Platform WG as well a bug fixes from bugs not shared by the WHATWG.
        </p>
        <p>
          A separate document is published to document the differences between the HTML specified in this document and
          the language described in the HTML 4.01 specification. <a href="">[HTML5-DIFF]</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Design notes</h3>
        <p><em>This section is non-normative</em></p>
        <p>It must be admitted that many aspects of HTML appear at first glance to be nonsensical and inconsistent.</p>
        <p>HTML, its supporting DOM APIs, as well as many of its supporting technologies, have been developed over a
          period of several decades by a wide array of people with different priorities who, in many cases, did not
          know of each other’s existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Features have thus arisen from many sources, and have not always been designed in especially consistent ways.
          Furthermore, because of the unique characteristics of the Web, implementation bugs have often become
          de-facto, and now de-jure, standards, as content is often unintentionally written in ways that rely on them
          before they can be fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite all this, efforts have been made to adhere to certain design goals. These are described in the next
          few subsections.
        </p>
        <h4> Serializability of script execution </h4>
        <p><em> This section is non-normative. </em></p>
        <p>
          To avoid exposing Web authors to the complexities of multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs are designed such
          that no script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other scripts. Even with
          <code><a href = "">workers</a></code>, the intent is that the behavior of implementations can be thought of as completely serializing the execution
          of all scripts in all <a href = "">wbrowsing contexts</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Compliance with other specifications</h4>
        <p><em> This section is non-normative. </em></p>
        <p>This specification interacts with and relies on a wide variety of other specifications. In certain
          circumstances, unfortunately, conflicting needs have led to this specification violating the requirements of
          these other specifications. Whenever this has occurred, the transgressions have each been noted as a
          ""<dfn>willful violation</dfn>"", and the reason for the violation has been noted.
        </p>
        <h4>Extensibility</h4>
        <p><em> This section is non-normative. </em></p>
        <p>HTML has a wide array of extensibility mechanisms that can be used for adding semantics in a safe manner:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Authors can use the <code><a href = "">class</a></code> attribute to extend elements, effectively creating their own elements, while
              using the most applicable existing "real" HTML element, so that browsers and other tools that don’t know
              of the extension can still support it somewhat well. This is the tack used by microformats, for example.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Authors can include data for inline client-side scripts or server-side site-wide scripts to process using
              the <code><a href = "">data-*=""</a></code> attributes. These are guaranteed to never be touched by browsers, and allow scripts to
              include data on HTML elements that scripts can then look for and process.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Authors can use the <code><a href = ""> meta name="" content="" </a> </code>mechanism to
              include page-wide metadata by registering <a href = "">extensions to the predefined set of metadata
              names.</a>
            </p>
          <li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Authors can embed raw data using the  <code><a href = "">script type=""</a> </code>
              mechanism with a custom type, for further handling by inline or server-side scripts.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Authors can extend APIs using the JavaScript prototyping mechanism. This is widely used by script
              libraries, for instance.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>HTML vs XML Syntax </h3>
        <p><em> This section is non-normative. </em></p>
        <p>
          This specification defines an abstract language for describing documents and applications, and some APIs for
          interacting with in-memory representations of resources that use this language.
        </p>
        <p>
          The in-memory representation is known as "DOM HTML", or "the DOM" for short.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit resources that use this abstract language,
          two of which are defined in this specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first such concrete syntax is the HTML syntax. This is the format suggested for most authors. It is
          compatible with most legacy Web browsers. If a document is transmitted with
          the <code><a href="">text/html</a></code>  <a href=""> MIME type</a>  then it will be processed as an HTML
          document by Web browsers. This specification defines the latest version of the HTML syntax, known simply as
          "HTML".
        </p>
        <p>
          The second concrete syntax is the XHTML syntax, which is an application of XML. When a document is transmitted
          with an <a href =""> XML MIME type</a>, such as <code><a href="">application/xhtml+xml</a></code>,
          then it is treated as an XML document by Web browsers, to be parsed by an XML processor. Authors are reminded
          that the processing for XML and HTML differs; in particular, even minor syntax errors will prevent a document
          labeled as XML from being rendered fully, whereas they would be ignored in the HTML syntax. This specification
          defines the latest version of the XHTML syntax, known simply as "XHTML".
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM, the HTML syntax, and the XHTML syntax cannot all represent the same content. For example, namespaces
          cannot be represented using the HTML syntax, but they are supported in the DOM and in the XHTML syntax.
          Similarly, documents that use the <code><a href="">noscript</a></code>feature can be represented using the
          HTML syntax, but cannot be represented with the DOM or in the XHTML syntax. Comments that contain the string
          "<code><a href="">--></a></code>" can only be represented in the DOM, not in the HTML and XHTML syntaxes.
        </p>

        <h3>Structure of this specification</h3>
        <p><em> This section is non-normative. </em></p>
        <p>This specification is divided into the following major sections:</p>

            </dt>
            <dd>
              The conformance classes, algorithms, definitions, and the common underpinnings of the rest of the
              specification.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <a href="">Semantics, structure, and APIs of HTML documents</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              Documents are built from elements. These elements form a tree using the DOM. This section defines the
              features of this DOM, as well as introducing the features common to all elements, and the concepts used
              in defining elements.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <a href="">The elements of HTML</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              Each element has a predefined meaning, which is explained in this section. Rules for authors on how to use
              the element, along with user agent requirements for how to handle each element, are also given. This
              includes large signature features of HTML such as video playback and subtitles, form controls and form
              submission, and a 2D graphics API known as the HTML canvas.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <a href="">User interaction</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              HTML documents can provide a number of mechanisms for users to interact with and modify content, which
              are described in this section, such as how focus works, and drag-and-drop.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <a href="">Loading Web pages</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>HTML documents do not exist in a vacuum — this section defines many of the features that affect
              environments that deal with multiple pages, such as Web browsers and offline caching of Web
              applications.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <a href="">Web application APIs</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>This section introduces basic features for scripting of applications in HTML.

              <a href="">The HTML syntax</a>

            <dt>
              <a href="">The XML syntax</a>
            </dt>
            <dd> All of these features would be for naught if they couldn’t be represented in a serialized form and
              sent to other people, and so these sections define the syntaxes of HTML and XHTML, along with rules for
              how to parse content using those syntaxes.
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <a href="">Rendering</a>
            </dt>

        <h4>How to read this specification</h4>
        <p>
          This specification should be read like all other specifications. First, it should be read cover-to-cover,
          multiple times. Then, it should be read backwards at least once. Then it should be read by picking random
          sections from the contents list and following all the cross-references.
        </p>
        <p>
          As described in the conformance requirements section below, this specification describes conformance criteria
          for a variety of conformance classes. In particular, there are conformance requirements that apply to
          <em>producers</em>, for example authors and the documents they create, and there are conformance requirements
          that apply to <em>consumers</em>, for example Web browsers. They can be distinguished by what they are
          requiring: a requirement on a producer states what is allowed, while a requirement on a consumer states how
          software is to act.
        </p>
        <div class ="example">
          <p>
            For example, "the <code><a href="">foo</a></code> attribute’s value must be a <a href="" >valid integer</a>" is
            a requirement on producers, as it lays out the allowed values; in contrast, the requirement
            "the <code><a href="">foo</a></code> attribute’s value must be parsed using the
            <a href="" >rules for parsing integers</a>" is a requirement on consumers, as it describes how to process
            the content.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Requirements on producers have no bearing whatsoever on consumers.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <div class ="example">
          <p>
            Continuing the above example, a requirement stating that a particular attribute’s value is constrained to
            being a <a href="">valid integer</a> emphatically does not imply anything about the requirements on
            consumers. It might be that the consumers are in fact required to treat the attribute as an opaque string,
            completely unaffected by whether the value conforms to the requirements or not. It might be (as in the
            previous example) that the consumers are required to parse the value using specific rules that define how
            invalid (non-numeric in this case) values are to be processed.

          In some cases, requirements are given in the form of lists with conditions and corresponding requirements.
          In such cases, the requirements that apply to a condition are always the first set of requirements that
          follow the condition, even in the case of there being multiple sets of conditions for those requirements.
          Such cases are presented as follows:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>This is a condition</dt>
          <dt>This is another condition</dt>
          <dd>This is the requirement that applies to the conditions above.</dd>
          <dt>This is a third condition</dt>
          <dd>This is the requirement that applies to the third condition. </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Privacy concerns</h3>
        <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
        <p>Some features of HTML trade user convenience for a measure of user privacy.</p>
        <p>
          In general, due to the Internet’s architecture, a user can be distinguished from another by the user’s IP
          address. IP addresses do not perfectly match to a user; as a user moves from device to device, or from
          network to network, their IP address will change; similarly, NAT routing, proxy servers, and shared computers
          enable packets that appear to all come from a single IP address to actually map to multiple users.
          Technologies such as onion routing can be used to further anonymize requests so that requests from a single
          user at one node on the Internet appear to come from many disparate parts of the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the IP address used for a user’s requests is not the only mechanism by which a user’s requests could
          be related to each other. Cookies, for example, are designed specifically to enable this, and are the basis
          of most of the Web’s session features that enable you to log into a site with which you have an account.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other mechanisms that are more subtle. Certain characteristics of a user’s system can be used to
          distinguish groups of users from each other; by collecting enough such information, an individual user’s
          browser’s "digital fingerprint" can be computed, which can be as good, if not better, as an IP address in
          ascertaining which requests are from the same user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grouping requests in this manner, especially across multiple sites, can be used for both benign (and even
          arguably positive) purposes, as well as for malevolent purposes. An example of a reasonably benign purpose
          would be determining whether a particular person seems to prefer sites with dog illustrations as opposed to
          sites with cat illustrations (based on how often they visit the sites in question) and then automatically
          using the preferred illustrations on subsequent visits to participating sites. Malevolent purposes, however,
          could include governments combining information such as the person’s home address (determined from the
          addresses they use when getting driving directions on one site) with their apparent political affiliations
          (determined by examining the forum sites that they participate in) to determine whether the person should
          be prevented from voting in an election.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the malevolent purposes can be remarkably evil, user agent implementors are encouraged to consider how
          to provide their users with tools to minimize leaking information that could be used to fingerprint a user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, as the first paragraph in this section implies, sometimes there is great benefit to be derived
          from exposing the very information that can also be used for fingerprinting purposes, so it’s not as easy as
          simply blocking all possible leaks. For instance, the ability to log into a site to post under a specific
          identity requires that the user’s requests be identifiable as all being from the same user. More subtly,
          though, information such as how wide text is, which is necessary for many effects that involve drawing text
          onto a canvas (e.g., any effect that involves drawing a border around the text) also leaks information that
          can be used to group a user’s requests. (In this case, by potentially exposing, via a brute force search,
          which fonts a user has installed, information which can vary considerably from user to user.)

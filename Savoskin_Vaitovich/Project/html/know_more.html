    Preparation and procedure of blood donation in UK
</header>
<main class="main">
    <h2 class="main__big__h2">Welcome and preparation</h2>
    <p class="main__p">Before donating blood, please eat regular meals , drink plenty of fluid (non-alcoholic) and
        avoid vigorous exercise or exertion.</p>

    <p class="main__p">Remember to bring your completed donor healthcheck form with you, if you received one from us in the post.
    If you ever need to cancel a donation appointment we ask that you give us 3 days’ notice so that we can offer
        your appointment to another donor.</p>

    <p class="main__p">We must give you sufficient information so that you can make an informed choice, on the benefits and risks
        of donating blood and samples for testing.</p>

    <p class="main__p">We will provide 500ml of fluid just before you donate. By drinking this over about 5 minutes, it will help
    with your wellbeing during and after donation.</p>

    <h2 class="main__big__h2">Health screening</h2>

    <p class="main__p">You will be called for private health screening, where a donor carer will confirm your identity.
        It’s critical that we guarantee an accurate link between you,
        your Donor Health Check and your donation.</p>

    <p class="main__p">We must ensure that it’s safe for you to donate and your donation is safe for a patient to receive. We’ll ask
        some confidential questions based on your completed Donor Health Check.</p>

    <p class="main__p">There is a period of time from contact with any infection to detecting markers in the laboratory.
        We trust your honesty when answering these personal questions. This will ensure your blood
        is safe to transfuse to patients.</p>

    <p class="main__p">You may be referred to a registered nurse for certain medical queries: their uniforms have red piping on
        the collar and cuffs. An explanation will always be provided if you are not able to donate.
        You will be advised when you can donate, and we’ll encourage you to make an appointment before you leave
        (the team are only able to book future appointments for the venue they are currently at).</p>

    <p class="main__p">For your wellbeing, we must ensure you have enough haemoglobin (iron) in your blood before donating.
        A small blood sample will be taken from your finger to test your haemoglobin levels. If your test is borderline,
        we will offer you a confirmatory test. This requires a sample of blood from your arm, to be tested in
        a machine at the session. We will advise you of the result.</p>

    <p class="main__p">Following health screening, you will be asked to sit in a different waiting area. From here you’ll
        be called and invited to a donation chair. You can find out more about health and travel eligibility
        for blood donors here.</p>

    <h2 class="main__big__h2">Your donation</h2>

    <p class="main__p">When you are comfortable on the chair, you will be asked your name, address and date of birth again.</p>

    <p class="main__p">Blood bags and sample tubes are labelled with unique donor identification numbers. All collection equipment
        is single use and sterile; only one blood bag is filled with your donation.</p>

    <p class="main__p">A blood pressure cuff will be placed on your arm to maintain a small amount of pressure during your donation.
        The cuff is not used to measure blood pressure.</p>

    <p class="main__p">Your arm will be thoroughly examined to find a suitable vein before being cleaned with an antiseptic sponge.
        This kills normal bacteria (germs) on the skin. You will see staff cleaning their hands frequently, using hand
        wipes or gels.</p>

    <p class="main__p">Donors are advised to do applied muscle tension exercises during donation. This is to maintain blood pressure
        and promote wellbeing during and after donation.</p>

    <p class="main__p">Following needle insertion you should be comfortable during your donation. If you experience any discomfort
        or pain please alert a member of staff.</p>

    <p class="main__p">An agitator scale constantly weighs and measures your donation. It will stop automatically when your donation is
        complete. Donor carers will be available to you throughout your donation.</p>

    <p class="main__p">You may hear beeping noises from the agitator, these inform us of the progress of your donation.
        A full donation is 470ml and will usually take between 5 and 10 minutes.</p>

    <p class="main__p">If you require assistance or have any concerns, please make us aware by raising your non-donation arm.
        After donation, the needle will be removed and a sterile dressing applied to your arm.</p>

    <p class="main__p">We advise that you leave the pressure roll on for 30 minutes and the plaster dressing on for 6 hours.
        Please avoid using this arm to push on or to carry anything heavy.</p>

    <p class="main__p">We will give you a card at the end of your donation with important care advice.
        Donors are also asked to apply additional pressure to the venepuncture site while waiting for their drink
        at the refreshment area.</p>

    <h2 class="main__big__h2">After donation refreshment</h2>

    <p class="main__p">A selection of drinks and snacks are available at the refreshment table. We encourage donors to relax here for
        at least 15 minutes and to have at least 2 drinks following donation.</p>

    <p class="main__p">If you feel unwell, please remain seated and alert a member of staff immediately. Where possible,
        we encourage you to book an appointment for your next donation.</p>

    <h2 class="main__big__h2">At home</h2>

    <p>If you become unwell (other than a cold or cold-sore) within 2 weeks following your donation, or if you believe
        there is a reason your blood should not be given to a patient,
        please contact the donor center of your country.</p>

    <p>Please do not have a hot bath on the day of your donation. </p>

Can you explain the difference between coding a web site to be responsive versus using a mobile-first strategy?

When you use a mobile first strategy, you first create a mobile version of the website and than try to exapand it to the desktop version. Sometimes it is more easier because mobile version has less elements than desktop version and thats why you only need to add some code and not to delete it. And when making a responsive site you create a desktop version and then you media queries to change it look for other devices.

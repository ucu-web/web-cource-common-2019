                <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
                <p>
                   HTML is the World Wide Web’s core markup language. Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a
                   language for semantically describing scientific documents. Its general design, however, has enabled
                   it to be adapted, over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents and
                   even applications.
                </p>

                <h3>1.2. Audience</h3>
                <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
                <p>
                    This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features defined
                    in this specification, implementors of tools that operate on pages that use the features defined
                    in this specification, and individuals wishing to establish the correctness of documents or
                    implementations with respect to the requirements of this specification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing
                    familiarity with Web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity
                    for completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler
                    introduction to the topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a complete understanding
                    of some of the more technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP,
                    XML, Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in places but is not
                    essential.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>1.3. Scope</h3>
                <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
                <p>
                    This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup language and associated
                    semantic-level scripting APIs for authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static
                    documents to dynamic applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scope of this specification does not include providing mechanisms for media-specific
                    customization of presentation (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included
                    at the end of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking into CSS are provided as
                    part of the language).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system. In particular,
                    hardware configuration software, image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be
                    expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. In terms of
                    applications, this specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be expected
                    to be used by users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate locations, with low
                    CPU requirements. Examples of such applications include online purchasing systems, searching
                    systems, games (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone books or address books,
                    communications software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software), document
                    editing software, etc.

                <h3>1.4. History</h3>
                <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
                <p>
                    For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a
                    number of extensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the creation of the W3C, HTML’s development changed venue again. A first abortive attempt at
                    extending HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as
                    HTML 3.2, which was completed in 1997. HTML 4.01 quickly followed later that same year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following year, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on
                    an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML. This effort started with a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in
                    XML, known as XHTML 1.0, which added no new features except the new serialization, and which was
                    completed in 2000. After XHTML 1.0, the W3C’s focus turned to making it easier for other working
                    groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C
                    also worked on a new language that was not compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages,
                    calling it XHTML 2.0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Around the time that HTML’s evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML developed by
                    browser vendors were specified and published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM Level 2
                    Core and DOM Level 2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in 2003). These efforts then petered
                    out, with some DOM Level 3 specifications published in 2004 but the working group being closed
                    before all the Level 3 drafts were completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was positioned as the next generation of Web
                    forms, sparked a renewed interest in evolving HTML itself, rather than finding replacements for it.
                    This interest was borne from the realization that XML’s deployment as a Web technology was limited
                    to entirely new technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than as a replacement for existing
                    deployed technologies (like HTML).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML 4.01’s forms to provide many of the
                    features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines that
                    were incompatible with existing HTML Web pages, was the first result of this renewed interest. At
                    this early stage, while the draft was already publicly available, and input was already being
                    solicited from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software’s copyright.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea that HTML’s evolution should be reopened was tested at a W3C workshop in 2004, where some
                    of the principles that underlie the HTML work (described below), as well as the aforementioned
                    early draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented to the W3C jointly by
                    Mozilla and Opera. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal conflicted with the
                    previously chosen direction for the Web’s evolution; the W3C staff and membership voted to continue
                    developing XML-based replacements instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue working on
                    the effort under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG. A public mailing list was created,
                    and the draft was moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was subsequently amended to be jointly
                    owned by all three vendors, and to allow reuse of the specification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The WHATWG was based on several core principles, in particular that technologies need to be
                    backwards compatible, that specifications and implementations need to match even if this means
                    changing the specification rather than the implementations, and that specifications need to be
                    detailed enough that implementations can achieve complete interoperability without
                    reverse-engineering each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The latter requirement in particular required that the scope of the HTML specification include
                    what had previously been specified in three separate documents: HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.1, and DOM
                    Level 2 HTML. It also meant including significantly more detail than had previously been considered
                    the norm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML 5.0 after all,
                    and in 2007 formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the
                    HTML specification. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification under
                    the W3C copyright, while keeping a version with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a number of years, both groups then worked together under the same editor: Ian Hickson.
                    In 2011, the groups came to the conclusion that they had different goals: the W3C wanted to draw
                    a line in the sand for features for a HTML 5.0 Recommendation, while the WHATWG wanted to continue
                    working on a Living Standard for HTML, continuously maintaining the specification and adding new
                    features. In mid 2012, a new editing team was introduced at the W3C to take care of creating a
                    HTML 5.0 Recommendation and prepare a Working Draft for the next HTML version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, the W3C Web Platform WG has been cherry picking patches from the WHATWG that resolved
                    bugs registered on the W3C HTML specification or more accurately represented implemented reality
                    in user agents. At time of publication of this document, patches from the
                    <a href="#">WHATWG HTML specification</a>
                    have been merged until January 12, 2016. The W3C HTML editors have also added patches that resulted
                    from discussions and decisions made by the W3C Web Platform WG as well a bug fixes from bugs not
                    shared by the WHATWG.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A separate document is published to document the differences between the HTML specified in this
                    document and the language described in the HTML 4.01 specification. <a href="#">[HTML5-DIFF]</a>

                <h3>1.5. Design notes</h3>
                <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
                <p>
                    It must be admitted that many aspects of HTML appear at first glance to be nonsensical and
                    inconsistent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HTML, its supporting DOM APIs, as well as many of its supporting technologies, have been developed
                    over a period of several decades by a wide array of people with different priorities who, in many
                    cases, did not know of each other’s existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Features have thus arisen from many sources, and have not always been designed in especially
                    consistent ways. Furthermore, because of the unique characteristics of the Web, implementation
                    bugs have often become de-facto, and now de-jure, standards, as content is often unintentionally
                    written in ways that rely on them before they can be fixed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite all this, efforts have been made to adhere to certain design goals. These are described
                    in the next few subsections.

                    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
                    <p>
                        To avoid exposing Web authors to the complexities of multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs are
                        designed such that no script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other scripts. Even
                        with <a href="#">workers</a>, the intent is that the behavior of implementations can be thought
                        of as completely serializing the execution of all scripts in all <a href="#">browsing
                        contexts</a>.

                    <p>
                        This specification interacts with and relies on a wide variety of other specifications. In
                        certain circumstances, unfortunately, conflicting needs have led to this specification
                        violating the requirements of these other specifications. Whenever this has occurred, the
                        transgressions have each been noted as a "<strong>willful violation</strong>", and the reason
                        for the violation has been noted.

                        HTML has a wide array of extensibility mechanisms that can be used for adding semantics in a
                        safe manner:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Authors can use the <a href="#">class</a> attribute to extend elements, effectively
                            creating their own elements, while using the most applicable existing "real" HTML
                            element, so that browsers and other tools that don’t know of the extension can still
                            support it somewhat well. This is the tack used by microformats, for example.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Authors can include data for inline client-side scripts or server-side site-wide
                            scripts to process using the <a href="#">data-*=""</a> attributes. These are guaranteed
                            to never be touched by browsers, and allow scripts to include data on HTML
                            elements that scripts can then look for and process.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Authors can use the <a href="#">meta name="" content=""</a> mechanism to include
                            page-wide metadata by <a href="#">registering extensions to the predefined set of
                            metadata names.</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Authors can use the <a href="#"> rel=""</a> mechanism to annotate links with specific
                            meanings by registering <a href="#">extensions to the predefined set of link types.</a>
                            This is also used by microformats.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Authors can embed raw data using the <a href="#"> script type=""</a> mechanism with a
                            custom type, for further handling by inline or server-side scripts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Authors can extend APIs using the JavaScript prototyping mechanism. This is widely used
                            by script libraries, for instance.
                        </li>

                <h3>1.6. HTML vs XML Syntax</h3>
                <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
                <p>
                    This specification defines an abstract language for describing documents and applications, and
                    some APIs for interacting with in-memory representations of resources that use this language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The in-memory representation is known as "DOM HTML", or "the DOM" for short.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit resources that use this
                    abstract language, two of which are defined in this specification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first such concrete syntax is the HTML syntax. This is the format suggested for most authors.
                    It is compatible with most legacy Web browsers. If a document is transmitted with the
                    <a href="#"> text/html</a> <a href="#"> MIME type</a>, then it will be processed as an HTML
                    document by Web browsers. This specification defines the latest version of the HTML syntax,
                    known simply as "HTML".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second concrete syntax is the XHTML syntax, which is an application of XML. When a document
                    is transmitted with an <a href="#"> XML MIME type</a>, such as
                    <a href="#">application/xhtml+xml</a>, then it is treated as an XML document by Web browsers,
                    to be parsed by an XML processor. Authors are reminded that the processing for XML and HTML
                    differs; in particular, even minor syntax errors will prevent a document labeled as XML from
                    being rendered fully, whereas they would be ignored in the HTML syntax. This specification
                    defines the latest version of the XHTML syntax, known simply as "XHTML".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The DOM, the HTML syntax, and the XHTML syntax cannot all represent the same content.
                    For example, namespaces cannot be represented using the HTML syntax, but they are supported
                    in the DOM and in the XHTML syntax. Similarly, documents that use the <a href="#">noscript</a>
                    feature can be represented using the HTML syntax, but cannot be represented with the DOM or in
                    the XHTML syntax. Comments that contain the string "-->" can only be represented in the DOM,
                    not in the HTML and XHTML syntaxes.

                <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
                <p>
                    This specification is divided into the following major sections:

                <dl>
                    <dt><a href="#">§1 Introduction</a></dt>

                    <dd>The conformance classes, algorithms, definitions, and the common underpinnings of the

                    <dt><a href="#">§3 Semantics, structure, and APIs of HTML documents</a></dt>
                    <dd>Documents are built from elements. These elements form a tree using the DOM. This section
                        defines the features of this DOM, as well as introducing the features common to all elements,
                        and the concepts used in defining elements.</dd>
                    <dt><a href="#">§4 The elements of HTML</a></dt>
                    <dd>Each element has a predefined meaning, which is explained in this section. Rules for authors
                        on how to use the element, along with user agent requirements for how to handle each element,
                        are also given. This includes large signature features of HTML such as video playback and
                        subtitles, form controls and form submission, and a 2D graphics API known as
                        the HTML canvas.</dd>

                    <dd>HTML documents do not exist in a vacuum — this section defines many of the features that

                        along with rules for how to parse content using those syntaxes.</dd>
                    <dt><a href="#">§10 Rendering</a></dt>
                    <dd>This section defines the default rendering rules for Web browsers.</dd>

                    <h4>1.7.1. How to read this specification</h4>
                    <p>
                        This specification should be read like all other specifications. First, it should be read
                        cover-to-cover, multiple times. Then, it should be read backwards at least once. Then it
                        should be read by picking random sections from the contents list and following all the
                        cross-references.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As described in the conformance requirements section below, this specification describes
                        conformance criteria for a variety of conformance classes. In particular, there are conformance
                        requirements that apply to <i>producers</i>, for example authors and the documents they create,
                        and there are conformance requirements that apply to <i>consumers</i>, for example Web
                        browsers. They can be distinguished by what they are requiring: a requirement on a producer
                        states what is allowed, while a requirement on a consumer states how software is to act.
                    </p>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h5>EXAMPLE 1</h5>
                        <p>
                            For example, "the foo attribute’s value must be a <a href="#">valid integer"</a> is a
                            requirement on producers, as it lays out the allowed values; in contrast, the requirement
                            "the foo attribute’s value must be parsed using <a href="#">the rules for parsing
                            integers"</a> is a requirement on consumers, as it describes how to process the content.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Requirements on producers have no bearing whatsoever on consumers.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h5>EXAMPLE 2</h5>
                        <p>
                            Continuing the above example, a requirement stating that a particular attribute’s value
                            is constrained to being a <a href="#">valid integer</a> emphatically does <i>not</i> imply
                            anything about the requirements on consumers. It might be that the consumers are in fact
                            required to treat the attribute as an opaque string, completely unaffected by whether the
                            value conforms to the requirements or not. It might be (as in the previous example) that
                            the consumers are required to parse the value using specific rules that define how invalid
                            (non-numeric in this case) values are to be processed.
                        </p>

                        set of requirements that follow the condition, even in the case of there being multiple sets

                    In general, due to the Internet’s architecture, a user can be distinguished from another by the
                    user’s IP address. IP addresses do not perfectly match to a user; as a user moves from device to
                    device, or from network to network, their IP address will change; similarly, NAT routing, proxy
                    servers, and shared computers enable packets that appear to all come from a single IP address to
                    actually map to multiple users. Technologies such as onion routing can be used to further anonymize
                    requests so that requests from a single user at one node on the Internet appear to come from many
                    disparate parts of the network.

                    However, the IP address used for a user’s requests is not the only mechanism by which a user’s
                    requests could be related to each other. Cookies, for example, are designed specifically to enable
                    this, and are the basis of most of the Web’s session features that enable you to log into a site
                    with which you have an account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are other mechanisms that are more subtle. Certain characteristics of a user’s system can be
                    used to distinguish groups of users from each other; by collecting enough such information, an
                    individual user’s browser’s "digital fingerprint" can be computed, which can be as good, if not
                    better, as an IP address in ascertaining which requests are from the same user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grouping requests in this manner, especially across multiple sites, can be used for both benign
                    (and even arguably positive) purposes, as well as for malevolent purposes. An example of a
                    reasonably benign purpose would be determining whether a particular person seems to prefer sites
                    with dog illustrations as opposed to sites with cat illustrations (based on how often they visit
                    the sites in question) and then automatically using the preferred illustrations on subsequent
                    visits to participating sites. Malevolent purposes, however, could include governments combining
                    information such as the person’s home address (determined from the addresses they use when getting
                    driving directions on one site) with their apparent political affiliations (determined by examining
                    the forum sites that they participate in) to determine whether the person should be prevented from
                    voting in an election.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the malevolent purposes can be remarkably evil, user agent implementors are encouraged to
                    consider how to provide their users with tools to minimize leaking information that could be used
                    to fingerprint a user.

                    Unfortunately, as the first paragraph in this section implies, sometimes there is great benefit to
                    be derived from exposing the very information that can also be used for fingerprinting purposes,
                    so it’s not as easy as simply blocking all possible leaks. For instance, the ability to log into
                    a site to post under a specific identity requires that the user’s requests be identifiable as all
                    being from the same user. More subtly, though, information such as how wide text is, which is
                    necessary for many effects that involve drawing text onto a canvas (e.g., any effect that involves
                    drawing a border around the text) also leaks information that can be used to group a user’s
                    requests. (In this case, by potentially exposing, via a brute force search, which fonts a user
                    has installed, information which can vary considerably from user to user.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Features in this specification which can be <strong>used to fingerprint the user</strong> are
                    marked as this paragraph is. (This is a fingerprinting vector.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other features in the platform can be used for the same purpose, though, including, though not
                    limited to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The exact list of which features a user agents supports.                                 </li>
                    <li>The maximum allowed stack depth for recursion in script.                                 </li>
                    <li>Features that describe the user’s environment, like Media Queries and
                        the <a href="#">Screen</a> object. <a href="#">[MEDIAQ]</a><a href="#">[CSSOM-VIEW]</a>  </li>
                    <li>The user’s time zone.                                                                    </li>

                <h3>1.9. A quick introduction to HTML</h3>
                <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
                <p>A basic HTML document looks like this:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre>
                        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                        &lt;html&gt;
                           &lt;head&gt;
                             &lt;title&gt;Sample page&lt;/title&gt;
                           &lt;/head&gt;
                           &lt;body&gt;
                             &lt;h1&gt;Sample page&lt;/h1&gt;
                             &lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href="demo.html"&gt;simple&lt;/a&gt; sample.&lt;/p&gt;
                             &lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt;
                           &lt;/body&gt;
                        &lt;/html&gt;
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    HTML documents consist of a tree of elements and text. Each element is denoted in the source by
                    a <a href="#"> start tag</a>, such as <a href="#">"body"</a>, and an <a href="#">end tag</a>, such
                    as "<a href="#">"body"</a>". (Certain start tags and end tags can in certain cases be
                    <a href="#"> omitted</a> and are implied by other tags.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tags have to be nested such that elements are all completely within each other, without overlapping:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre>&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;very &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
                </div>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is &lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    This specification defines a set of elements that can be used in HTML, along with rules about
                    the ways in which the elements can be nested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements work. In the example below, there
                    is a <a href="#">hyperlink</a>, formed using the <a href="#">a</a> element and its
                    <a href="#">href</a> attribute:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre>&lt;a href="demo.html"&gt;simple&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <a href="#">Attributes</a> are placed inside the start tag, and consist of a <a href="#">name</a>
                    and a <a href="#">value</a>, separated by an "=" character. The attribute value can remain
                    <a href="#">unquoted</a> if it doesn’t contain <a href="#">space characters</a> or any of
                    " ' ` = < or >. Otherwise, it has to be quoted using either single or double quotes. The value,
                    along with the "=" character, can be omitted altogether if the value is the empty string.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre>
                        &lt;!-- empty attributes --&gt;
                        &lt;input name=address disabled&gt;
                        &lt;input name=address disabled=""&gt;

                        &lt;!-- attributes with a value --&gt;
                        &lt;input name=address maxlength=200&gt;
                        &lt;input name=address maxlength='200'&gt;
                        &lt;input name=address maxlength="200"&gt;
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    HTML user agents (e.g., Web browsers) then <a href="#">parse</a> this markup, turning it into
                    a DOM (Document Object Model) tree. A DOM tree is an in-memory representation of a document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DOM trees contain several kinds of nodes, in particular a <a href="#">DocumentType</a> node,
                    <a href="#">Element</a> nodes, <a href="#">Text</a> nodes, <a href="#">Comment</a> nodes,
                    and in some cases <a href="#">ProcessingInstruction</a> nodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <a href="#">markup snippet at the top of this section</a> would be turned into the following
                    DOM tree:

                    There are many more <a href="#">Text</a> nodes in the DOM tree than one would initially expect,
                    because the source contains a number of spaces (represented here by "␣") and line breaks ("⏎")
                    that all end up as <a href="#">Text</a> nodes in the DOM. However, for historical reasons not all
                    of the spaces and line breaks in the original markup appear in the DOM. In particular, all the
                    white space before <a href="#">head</a> start tag ends up being dropped silently, and all the white
                    space after the <a href="#">body</a> end tag ends up placed at the end of the <a href="#">body</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <a href="#">head</a> element contains a <a href="#">title</a> element, which itself contains
                    a <a href="#">Text</a> node with the text "Sample page". Similarly, the <a href="#">body</a>
                    element contains an <a href="#">h1</a> element, a <a href="#">p</a> element, and a comment.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    This DOM tree can be manipulated from scripts in the page. Scripts (typically in JavaScript) are
                    small programs that can be embedded using the <a href="#">script</a> element or using
                    <a href="#">event handler content attributes</a>. For example, here is a form with a script that
                    sets the value of the form’s <a href="#">output</a> element to say "Hello World"
                </p>
                <pre>
                    &lt;form name="main"&gt;
                      Result: &lt;output name="result"&gt;&lt;/output&gt;
                      &lt;script&gt;
                        document.forms.main.elements.result.value = 'Hello World';
                      &lt;/script&gt;
                    &lt;/form&gt;
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Each element in the DOM tree is represented by an object, and these objects have APIs so that
                    they can be manipulated. For instance, a link (e.g., the <a href="#">a</a> element in the tree
                    above) can have its "<a href="#">href</a>" attribute changed in several ways:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    var a = document.links[0]; // obtain the first link in the document
                    a.href = 'sample.html'; // change the destination URL of the link
                    a.protocol = 'https'; // change just the scheme part of the URL
                    a.setAttribute('href', 'http://example.com/'); // change the content attribute directly
                </pre>
                <p>
                    Since DOM trees are used as the way to represent HTML documents when they are processed and
                    presented by implementations (especially interactive implementations like Web browsers), this
                    specification is mostly phrased in terms of DOM trees, instead of the markup described above.
                </p>

                    HTML documents represent a media-independent description of interactive content. HTML documents
                    might be rendered to a screen, or through a speech synthesizer, or on a braille display. To
                    influence exactly how such rendering takes place, authors can use a styling language such as CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the following example, the page has been made yellow-on-blue using CSS.

                        &lt;title&gt;Sample styled page&lt;/title&gt;
                        &lt;style&gt;
                          body { background: navy; color: yellow; }
                        &lt;/style&gt;
                      &lt;/head&gt;
                      &lt;body&gt;
                        &lt;h1&gt;Sample styled page&lt;/h1&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;This page is just a demo.&lt;/p&gt;
                      &lt;/body&gt;
                    &lt;/html&gt;

                    For more details on how to use HTML, authors are encouraged to consult tutorials and guides. Some
                    of the examples included in this specification might also be of use, but the novice author is
                    cautioned that this specification, by necessity, defines the language with a level of detail that
                    might be difficult to understand at first.

                    <p>
                        When HTML is used to create interactive sites, care needs to be taken to avoid introducing
                        vulnerabilities through which attackers can compromise the integrity of the site itself or of
                        the site’s users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A comprehensive study of this matter is beyond the scope of this document, and authors are
                        strongly encouraged to study the matter in more detail. However, this section attempts to
                        provide a quick introduction to some common pitfalls in HTML application development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The security model of the Web is based on the concept of "origins", and correspondingly many
                        of the potential attacks on the Web involve cross-origin actions. <a href="#">[ORIGIN]</a>
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Not validating user input  </dt>
                        <dt>Cross-site scripting (XSS) </dt>
                        <dt>SQL injection              </dt>
                        <p>
                            When accepting untrusted input, e.g., user-generated content such as text comments, values
                            in URL parameters, messages from third-party sites, etc, it is imperative that the data
                            be validated before use, and properly escaped when displayed. Failing to do this can
                            allow a hostile user to perform a variety of attacks, ranging from the potentially
                            benign, such as providing bogus user information like a negative age, to the serious,
                            such as running scripts every time a user looks at a page that includes the information,
                            potentially propagating the attack in the process, to the catastrophic, such as deleting
                            all data in the server.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When writing filters to validate user input, it is imperative that filters always be
                            safelist-based, allowing known-safe constructs and disallowing all other input.
                            Blocklist-based filters that disallow known-bad inputs and allow everything else are not
                            secure, as not everything that is bad is yet known (for example, because it might be invented
                            in the future).
                        </p>
                        <div class="example">
                            <h5>EXAMPLE 4</h5>
                            <p>
                                For example, suppose a page looked at its URL’s query string to determine what to display,
                                and the site then redirected the user to that page to display a message, as in:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
                                &lt;ul&gt;
                                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Hello"&gt;Say Hello&lt;/a&gt;
                                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Welcome"&gt;Say Welcome&lt;/a&gt;
                                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Kittens"&gt;Say Kittens&lt;/a&gt;
                                &lt;/ul&gt;
                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                If the message was just displayed to the user without escaping, a hostile attacker could
                                then craft a URL that contained a script element:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
                                http://example.com/message.cgi?say=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27Oh%20no%21%27%29%3C/script%3E
                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                If the attacker then convinced a victim user to visit this page, a script of the
                                attacker’s choosing would run on the page. Such a script could do any number of hostile
                                actions, limited only by what the site offers: if the site is an e-commerce shop, for
                                instance, such a script could cause the user to unknowingly make arbitrarily many
                                unwanted purchases.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is called a cross-site scripting attack.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            There are many constructs that can be used to try to trick a site into executing code. Here
                            are some that authors are encouraged to consider when writing safelist filters:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    When allowing harmless-seeming elements like <code><a href="#">img</a></code>, it is
                                    important to safelist any provided attributes as well. If one allowed all attributes
                                    then an attacker could, for instance, use the <a href="#"><code>onload</code></a>
                                    attribute to run arbitrary script.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    When allowing URLs to be provided (e.g., for links), the scheme of each URL also needs to be
                                    explicitly safelisted, as there are many schemes that can be abused. The most prominent
                                    example is "<code>javascript:</code>", but user agents can implement (and indeed, have
                                    historically implemented) others.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Allowing a <code><a href="#">base</a></code> element to be inserted means any
                                    <code><a href="#">script</a></code> elements in the page with relative links can be
                                    hijacked, and similarly that any form submissions can get redirected to a hostile
                                    site.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                If a site allows a user to make form submissions with user-specific side-effects, for
                                example posting messages on a forum under the user’s name, making purchases, or
                                applying for a passport, it is important to verify that the request was made by the
                                user intentionally, rather than by another site tricking the user into making the
                                request unknowingly.
                            </p>
                            <p>This problem exists because HTML forms can be submitted to other origins.</p>
                            <p>
                                Sites can prevent such attacks by populating forms with user-specific hidden tokens, or by
                                checking <code>Origin</code> headers on all requests.
                            </p>

                                A page that provides users with an interface to perform actions that the user might not
                                wish to perform needs to be designed so as to avoid the possibility that users can be
                                tricked into activating the interface.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One way that a user could be so tricked is if a hostile site places the victim site in a
                                small <code><a href="#">iframe</a></code> and then convinces the user to click, for
                                instance by having the user play a reaction game. Once the user is playing the game,
                                the hostile site can quickly position the <code><a href="#">iframe</a></code> under the
                                mouse cursor just as the user is about to click, thus tricking the user into clicking
                                the victim site’s interface.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To avoid this, sites that do not expect to be used in frames are encouraged to only
                                enable their interface if they detect that they are not in a frame (e.g., by comparing
                                the <code><a href="#">window</a></code> object to the value of the
                                <code><a href="#">top</a></code> attribute).

                        Scripts in HTML have "run-to-completion" semantics, meaning that the browser will generally run
                        the script uninterrupted before doing anything else, such as firing further events or continuing
                        to parse the document.

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, parsing of HTML files happens incrementally, meaning that the parser can
                        pause at any point to let scripts run. This is generally a good thing, but it does mean that
                        authors need to be careful to avoid hooking event handlers after the events could have
                        possibly fired.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are two techniques for doing this reliably: use <a href="#">event handler content
                        attributes</a>, or create the element and add the event handlers in the same script. The latter
                        is safe because, as mentioned earlier, scripts are run to completion before further events can
                        fire.
                    </p>
                    <div class="example">
                        <h5>EXAMPLE 5</h5>
                        <p>
                            One way this could manifest itself is with <a href="#">img</a> elements and the
                            <a href="#">load</a> event. The event could fire as soon as the element has been parsed,
                            especially if the image has already been cached (which is common).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here, the author uses the <a href="#">onload</a> handler on an <a href="#">img</a> element
                            to catch the <a href="#">load</a> event:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                            &lt;img src="games.png" alt="Games" onload="gamesLogoHasLoaded(event)"&gt;
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                            If the element is being added by script, then so long as the event handlers are added in the
                            same script, the event will still not be missed:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                            &lt;script&gt;
                                var img = new Image();
                                img.src = 'games.png';
                                img.alt = 'Games';
                                img.onload = gamesLogoHasLoaded;
                                // img.addEventListener('load', gamesLogoHasLoaded, false); // would work also
                            &lt;/script&gt;
                        </pre>
                        <p>
                            However, if the author first created the <a href="#">img</a> element and then in
                            a separate script added the event listeners, there’s a chance that the <code>load</code>
                            event would be fired in between, leading it to be missed:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
                            <!-- Do not use this style, it has a race condition! -->
                            &lt;img id="games" src="games.png" alt="Games"&gt;
                            <!-- the 'load' event might fire here while the parser is taking a
                                break, in which case you will not see it! -->
                            &lt;script&gt;
                                var img = document.getElementById('games');
                                img.onload = gamesLogoHasLoaded; // might never fire!
                            &lt;/script&gt;

                        Authors are encouraged to make use of conformance checkers (also known as <i>validators</i>) to
                        catch common mistakes. The W3C provides a number of online validation services, including the
                        <a href="#">Nu Markup Validation Service</a>.

                <h3>1.10. Conformance requirements for authors</h3>
                <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
                <p>
                    Unlike previous versions of the HTML specification, this specification defines in some detail the
                    required processing for invalid documents as well as valid documents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, even though the processing of invalid content is in most cases well-defined, conformance
                    requirements for documents are still important: in practice, interoperability (the situation in
                    which all implementations process particular content in a reliable and identical or equivalent
                    way) is not the only goal of document conformance requirements. This section details some of the
                    more common reasons for still distinguishing between a
                    <a href="#">conforming document</a> and one with errors.

                    <h4>1.10.1. Presentational markup</h4>
                    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
                    <p>
                        The majority of presentational features from previous versions of HTML are no longer allowed.
                        Presentational markup in general has been found to have a number of problems:
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>The use of presentational elements leads to poorer accessibility</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                While it is possible to use presentational markup in a way that provides users of assistive
                                technologies (ATs) with an acceptable experience (e.g., using ARIA), doing so is significantly
                                more difficult than doing so when using semantically-appropriate markup. Furthermore,
                                even using such techniques doesn’t help make pages accessible for non-AT, non-graphical users,
                                such as users of text-mode browsers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using media-independent markup, on the other hand, provides an easy way for documents to be
                                authored in such a way that they are "accessible" for more users (e.g., users of text
                                browsers).
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Higher cost of maintenance</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                It is significantly easier to maintain a site written in such a way that the markup is
                                style-independent. For example, changing the color of a site that uses
                                <code>&lt;font color=""&gt;</code> throughout requires changes across the entire site,
                                whereas a similar change to a site based on CSS can be done by changing a single file.
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Larger document sizes</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                Presentational markup tends to be much more redundant, and thus results in larger document
                                sizes.
                            </p>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>
                        For those reasons, presentational markup has been removed from HTML in this version. This
                        change should not come as a surprise; HTML 4.0 deprecated presentational markup many years ago
                        and provided a mode (HTML Transitional) to help authors move away from presentational markup;
                        later, XHTML 1.1 went further and obsoleted those features altogether.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The only remaining presentational markup features in HTML are the <code><a href="#">
                        style</a></code> attribute and the <code><a href="#">style</a></code> element. Use of the
                        <code><a href="#">style</a></code> attribute is somewhat discouraged in production
                        environments, but it can be useful for rapid prototyping (where its rules can be
                        directly moved into a separate style sheet later) and for providing specific styles in unusual
                        cases where a separate style sheet would be inconvenient. Similarly, the
                        <code><a href="#">style</a></code> element can be useful in syndication or for page-specific
                        styles, but in general an external style sheet is likely to be more convenient when the styles
                        apply to multiple pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is also worth noting that some elements that were previously presentational have been
                        redefined in this specification to be media-independent: <code><a href="#">b</a></code>,
                        <code><a href="#">i</a></code>, <code><a href="#">hr</a></code>, <code><a href="#">s</a></code>,
                        <code><a href="#">small</a></code>, and <code><a href="#">u</a></code>.
                    </p>

                                    For example, the following markup fragment results in a DOM with an <code>
                                    <a href="#">hr</a></code> element that is an <em>earlier</em> sibling of the
                                    corresponding <code><a href="#">table</a></code> element:
                                    <code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</code>
                                </p>

                                To allow user agents to be used in controlled environments without having to implement the
                                more bizarre and convoluted error handling rules, user agents are permitted to fail whenever
                                encountering a <a href="#">parse error</a>.

                                (user agents that process HTML files in one pass, without storing state). To avoid
                                interoperability problems with such user agents, any syntax resulting in such behavior
                                is considered invalid.

                                When a user agent based on XML is connected to an HTML parser, it is possible that certain
                                invariants that XML enforces, such as element or attribute names never contain multiple
                                colons, will be violated by an HTML file. Handling this can require that the parser coerce the
                                HTML DOM into an XML-compatible infoset. Most syntax constructs that require such handling are
                                considered invalid. (Comments containing two consecutive hyphens, or ending with a hyphen, are
                                exceptions that are allowed in the HTML syntax.)

                                Certain syntax constructs can result in disproportionately poor performance. To

                                For example, the following markup results in poor performance, since all the unclosed
                                <code><a href="#">i</a></code> elements have to be reconstructed in each paragraph,
                                resulting in progressively more elements in each paragraph:

                                There are syntax constructs that, for historical reasons, are relatively fragile. To help
                                reduce the number of users who accidentally run into such problems, they are made
                                non-conforming.

                                    For example, the parsing of certain named character references in attributes happens even
                                    with the closing semicolon being omitted. It is safe to include an ampersand followed by
                                    letters that do not form a named character reference, but if the letters are changed to a
                                    string that <em>does</em> form a named character reference, they will be interpreted as that
                                    character instead.
                                </p>
                                <p>In this fragment, the attribute’s value is "<code>?bill&amp;ted</code>":</p>
                                <p>
                                    In the following fragment, however, the attribute’s value is actually
                                    "<code>?art©</code>", <em>not</em> the intended "<code>?art&amp;copy</code>",
                                    because even without the final semicolon, "<code>&amp;copy</code>" is handled the same
                                    as "<code>&amp;copy;</code>" and thus gets interpreted as "<code>©</code>":
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To avoid this problem, all named character references are required to end with a
                                    semicolon, and uses of named character references without a semicolon are flagged as
                                    errors.
                                </p>
                                <p>Thus, the correct way to express the above cases is as follows:</p>
                                <pre>
                                    &lt;a href="?bill&amp;ted"&gt;Bill and Ted&lt;a&gt;&lt;!-- &amp;ted is ok, since it’s
                                    not a named character reference --&gt;
                                </pre>
                                <pre>
                                    &lt;a href="?art&amp;amp;copy"&gt;Art and Copy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- the &amp; has to be
                                    escaped, since &amp;copy is a named character reference --&gt;
                                </pre>

                                When a user makes a simple typo, it is helpful if the error can be caught early, as this can
                                save the author a lot of debugging time. This specification therefore usually considers it
                                an error to use element names, attribute names, and so forth, that do not match the names
                                defined in this specification.

                                <code><a href="#">caption</a></code>, this would be flagged as an error and the author
                                could correctthe typo immediately.

                               For example, attributes in end tags are ignored currently, but they are invalid, in case

                        Some authors find it helpful to be in the practice of always quoting all attributes and always
                        including all optional tags, preferring the consistency derived from such custom over the minor
                        benefits of terseness afforded by making use of the flexibility of the HTML syntax. To aid such
                        authors, conformance checkers can provide modes of operation wherein such conventions are
                        enforced.

                        Beyond the syntax of the language, this specification also places restrictions on how elements
                        and attributes can be specified. These restrictions are present for similar reasons:

                            <p>To avoid misuse of elements with defined meanings, content models are defined that restrict

                                    simultaneously be a cell, nor can a radio button be a progress bar.

                                    <code><a href="#">li</a></code> element, it’s not clear what was meant.

                                    in an inline box is unnecessarily confusing; since either nesting just <code><a href="#">

                                    elements all serve the same purpose as nesting a <code><a href="#">div</a></code> element
                                    in a <code><a href="#">span</a></code> element, but only the latter involves a <a href="#">
                                    block box</a> in an <a href="#">inline box</a>, the latter combination is disallowed.

                                    Another example would be the way <a href="#">interactive content</a> cannot be
                                    nested. For example, a <code><a href="#">button</a></code> element cannot contain
                                    a <code><a href="#">textarea</a></code> element. This is because the default
                                    behavior of such nesting interactive elements would be highly confusing to users.
                                    Instead of nesting these elements, they can be placed side by side.

                            <p>Certain elements are parsed in somewhat eccentric ways (typically for historical
                                reasons), and their content model restrictions are intended to avoid exposing the
                                author to these issues.</p>
                            <div class="example">
                                <p>For example, a <code><a href="#">form</a></code> element isn’t allowed inside
                                    <a href="#">phrasing content</a>, because when parsed as HTML, a <code><a href="#">
                                    form</a></code> element’s start tag will imply a <code><a href="#">p</a></code>
                                    element’s end tag. Thus, the following markup results in two paragraphs, not one:</p>
                                <pre>&lt;p&gt;Welcome. &lt;form&gt;&lt;label&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;

                                <p>It is parsed exactly like the following:</p>

                                </code> attributes with the same value. Duplicate IDs lead to the wrong element being

                            <p>Some constructs are disallowed because historically they have been the cause of a lot of
                                wasted authoring time, and by encouraging authors to avoid making them, authors can
                                save time in future efforts.</p>
                            <div class="example">

                                    For example, a <code><a href="#">script</a></code> element’s <code><a href="#">src
                                    </a></code> attribute causes the element’s contents to be ignored. However, this
                                    isn’t obvious, especially if the element’s contents appear to be executable script
                                    — which can lead to authors spending a lot of time trying to debug the inline
                                    script without realizing that it is not executing. To reduce this problem, this
                                    specification makes it non-conforming to have executable script in a <code>
                                    <a href="#">script</a></code> element when the <code><a href="#">src</a></code>
                                    attribute is present. This means that authors who are validating their documents
                                    are less likely to waste time with this kind of mistake.

                                Some authors like to write files that can be interpreted as both XML and HTML with
                                similar results. Though this practice is discouraged in general due to the myriad of
                                subtle complications involved (especially when involving scripting, styling, or any
                                kind of automated serialization), this specification has a few restrictions intended
                                to at least somewhat mitigate the difficulties. This makes it easier for authors to use
                                this as a transitionary step when migrating between HTML and XHTML.
                            </p>

                                    For example, there are somewhat complicated rules surrounding the <a href="#">lang
                                    </a></code> and <a href="#">xml:lang</a></code> attributes intended to keep the two

                                    Another example would be the restrictions on the values of <a href="#">xmlns</a>
                                    </code> attributes in the HTML serialization, which are intended to ensure that
                                    elements in conforming documents end up in the same namespaces whether processed as
                                    HTML or XML.

                                As with the restrictions on the syntax intended to allow for new syntax in future
                                revisions of the language, some restrictions on the content models of elements and
                                values of attributes are intended to allow for future expansion of the HTML vocabulary.

                                    For example, limiting the values of the <a href="#">target</a></code> attribute
                                    that start with an U+005F LOW LINE character (_) to only specific predefined values

                        standards developers, and users should take into account, and provides specific recommendations
